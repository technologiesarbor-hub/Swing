/**
 * App-wide permission orchestration.
 *
 * We only need two OS-level permissions for the MVP:
 *   1. Notifications  — so plane arrivals / chat pings can wake the user
 *   2. Location       — radius filter + nearby matching
 *
 * iOS in particular dislikes back-to-back permission dialogs (the
 * second one frequently appears to be "swallowed" if it's queued while
 * the first sheet is still animating out). So we *sequence* the two
 * asks with a small inter-prompt gap and never block the UI.
 *
 * We also persist a "have we ever asked this user before?" flag in
 * AsyncStorage so we don't re-prompt every cold start — once the user
 * has chosen (Allow / Deny / Don't Ask Again), the OS owns the state
 * and we should not pester them again. Re-asking only makes sense
 * from explicit affordances (e.g. a settings toggle).
