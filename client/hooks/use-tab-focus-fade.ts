/**
 * Tiny reanimated hook that produces a "screen content fades + slides in
 * by a hair" animated style every time a tab gains focus.
 *
 * Direction-aware: the content slides in from the LEFT when you go
 * back to a previous tab, and from the RIGHT when moving forward.
 * That subtle directional cue is what makes tab switching read as a
 * proper pager transition instead of a hard jump.
 *
 * Combined with the bottom tab bar's animated indicator and icon scaling,
 * this gives a clear "kuch hua, tab change ho gaya" feel — without needing
 * react-native-pager-view (which doesn't work inside Expo Go).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const fadeStyle = useTabFocusFade();
 *   ...
 *   <Animated.View style={[styles.root, fadeStyle]}>...</Animated.View>
